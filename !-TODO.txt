		* Order parts


Glasses:
	
	
	- Find headlamp LED's. High intensity, need to decide on colour.
	- Electroluminescent wire and driver - Potentially use for glowing conduit.

Next time:
	- Order REG104-5 regulators
	- Find regulators for the charger circuitry
	- select diodes and pnp transistors for the charger circuit
	- add voltage read for charger circuit
