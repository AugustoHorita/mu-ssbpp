There is a good chance that this wasn’t what you were expecting after a full year of work. 

Surprise!

You might think that a year would be enough time to complete whatever fabulous creation we are working on. Most people would say you can create a lot in a year. Hell it only takes 9 months to grow a human, so you’re almost certainly wondering why instead of some awesome electrical gizmo, doo-dad or widget you are looking at some pieces of paper attached to a bit of wood and copper. 

 
It is nice paper though isn’t it. Maybe you should take a minute to appreciate it some more. MMM, good high gsm paper. Nice.

Done looking at it yet? OK so while a lot of things can be created in a year, not everything has to deal with overseas shipping delays, misquoted production times and unexpected public holidays in Thailand. Needless to say we are still working feverishly away at your truly awesome and spectacular birthday present. 

Ask anyone here; well anyone except Kat (Sorry about that Kat). We are certain that they will all say the present we are building will be amazing and ridiculous and completely what you want. 
 
Even though most of them haven’t even seen the work in progress yet, we are confident they will all back us up. No one more so than Vika and Megan who probably have the best idea of how much time we have been spending on this. (Sorry about that Vika and Megan)
And just so you don’t think we’ve been slacking off here are some of the key facts:

-	The MU directory now contains 2182 files
-	MU is made from 426 separate components
-	MU contains 13 individual circuit boards
-	It comes with 4 parts
-	It has a sweet carry case
-	There used to be a restaurant in Christchurch called MU

 
So we just need a touch more time to wait for the last few pieces to arrive and to put all the finishing touches on so you end up with an awesome birthday present instead of a large pile of parts. In the mean time you now have a sweet piece of wood to store with your key. Look there’s even a little hook there to store it.

A month should be plenty. Two tops.

Please don’t kill us.
